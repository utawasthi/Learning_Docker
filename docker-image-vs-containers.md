# Docker Images vs Containers

## What is a Docker Image?
A **Docker image** is a lightweight, stand-alone, and executable software package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, libraries, and system tools.

### Key Characteristics of Docker Images:
- They are **immutable**; once created, they do not change.
- They serve as a **template** to create containers.

## What is a Docker Container?
A **Docker container** is a **runtime instance** of a Docker image. It is an isolated and lightweight environment in which an application runs.

### Key Characteristics of Docker Containers:
- Containers are **temporary** and can be stopped or deleted.
- They are **portable**, meaning they can run anywhere Docker is supported.
