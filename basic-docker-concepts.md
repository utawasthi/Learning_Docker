# Basic Docker Concepts

## Docker Client
The Docker client is the **interface** used by the user to interact with the Docker daemon. It can be the command-line interface (CLI) or Docker Desktop's graphical interface.

## Docker Daemon
The Docker daemon is responsible for building, running, and managing Docker containers. It interacts with the client and handles the actual container lifecycle.

## Docker Images and Containers
- **Images**: Templates for containers.
- **Containers**: Running instances of images, isolated environments for executing applications.

## Docker Commands
- `docker run`: Starts a new container.
- `docker build`: Builds an image from a Dockerfile.
- `docker exec`: Executes commands inside a running container.
- `docker ps`: Displays running containers.
